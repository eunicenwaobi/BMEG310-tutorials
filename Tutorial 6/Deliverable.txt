FOXP3 (forkhead box P3), is a protein involved in immune system responses. FOXP3 appears to function
as a master regulator of the regulatory pathway in the development and function of regulatory T cells. 
Regulatory T cells generally turn the immune response down. Search for “foxp3” in UCSC, you will get
a lot of entries that match this search term, select the ones which has corresponding PDB entry.

(a) 	What is the sequence of the start codon? 

(b) 	What is the position in the chromosome of the first protein coding nucleotide? 

(c) 	What are the last 8 nucleotides of the 5’ UTR? 

(d) 	What are the Three first and three last nucleotides of intron 1? 

(e) 	Are there any common SNPs in the coding region? What is the identifier of SNP? What is the class
	of this SNP? Find its position. 

(f) 	Are there any common SNPs between Exon 5 and Exon 6? What is the identifier of SNP? What is the 
	name of its class? Find its position. Does this cause change to the encoded amino acid? Why?

FOXP3 (ENST00000376207.9) at chrX:49250436-49264924 - 
Homo sapiens forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), transcript variant 1, mRNA. (from RefSeq NM_014009)

Deliverable:

(a) 	The nucleotide sequencing of "ATG" reads "AUG" beginning the corresponding exon 
	sequence for FOXP3. This also implies that the cDNA strand reads "TAC."

(b) 	The first protein coding codon: Methionine (AUG, cDNA = TAC) is first sited at 
	ChrX:49,257,671 then, Phenylalanine(AAA, cDNA = TTT) is located at ChrX:49,257,672.

(c) 	The 8 nucleotides of the 5' UTR are found to be "aggacccg."

(d) 	(ENST00000376207.9 (FOXP3) length=2480) TAG aka UAG (UAG, cDNA = ATC) is the stop 
	codon on exon 2 preceding intron 1 and therefore "GCC" (cDNA = CGG) is the sequence
	of the first three nucleotides of intron 1. Additionally, the codon nucleotide sequence 
	before exon 1's AUG/ATG is found to be "TCC" (cDNA = AGG).

(e) 	(ENST00000376207.9): A common SNP of my selection was found to be "rs781797823" 
	(dbSNP build 151 rs781797823) at "chrX:49264844-49264843" with a class of 
	"insertion" and a color of red. This is clearly on exon 1 and results in a 
	non-synonymous change. 

(f) 	(ENST00000376207.9): The only green common SNP between exon 5 and exon 6 was selected and 
	found to be "rs2232367" (dbSNP build 151 rs2232367) at "chrX:49256855-49256855" with a 
	class of "single." The change caused is one that is synonymous and thus identified as
	a "sequence variant where there is no resulting change to the encoded amino acid." 
	If a selection of (ENST00000455775.7) had been made, this could also suffice as an 
	answer for (e).

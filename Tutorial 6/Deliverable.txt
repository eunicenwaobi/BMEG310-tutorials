FOXP3 (forkhead box P3), is a protein involved in immune system responses. FOXP3 appears to function
as a master regulator of the regulatory pathway in the development and function of regulatory T cells. 
Regulatory T cells generally turn the immune response down. Search for “foxp3” in UCSC, you will get
a lot of entries that match this search term, select the ones which has corresponding PDB entry.

FOXP3 (ENST00000376207.9) at chrX:49250436-49264924 - 
Homo sapiens forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), transcript variant 1, mRNA. (from RefSeq NM_014009)

Deliverable:

(a) 	The nucleotide sequencing of "ATG" reads "AUG" beginning the corresponding exon 
	sequence for FOXP3. This also implies that the cDNA strand reads "TAC."

(b) 	(ENST00000376207.9) The first protein coding codon: Methionine (AUG, cDNA = TAC) 
	is first sited at ChrX:49,257,671 then, Phenylalanine(AAA, cDNA = TTT) is located
	at ChrX:49,257,672.

(c) 	(ENST00000376207.9) The last 8 nucleotides of the 5' UTR are found to be "aggacccg." 
	The 5' UTR can be shown to be:
		auuauuagaagagagaggucugcggcuuccacaccguacagcgugguuuuucuucucgg
		uauaaaagcaaaguuguuuuugauacgugacaguuucccacaagccaggcugauccuuu
		ucugucaguccacuucaccaagccugcccuuggacaaggacccg

(d) 	(ENST00000376207.9 (FOXP3) length=2480) TAG aka UAG (UAG, cDNA = ATC) is the stop 
	codon on exon 2 preceding intron 1 and therefore "GCC" (cDNA = CGG) is the sequence
	of the first three nucleotides of intron 1. Additionally, the codon nucleotide sequence 
	before exon 1's AUG/ATG is found to be "TCC" (cDNA = AGG).

Therefore the solution is "dbSNP1 rs2232367, at location 49256854, 49256855 with a function of single
coding-synon".

(f) 	(ENST00000376207.9): The only green common SNP between exon 5 and exon 6 was selected and 
	found to be "rs2232367" (dbSNP build 151 rs2232367) at "chrX:49256855-49256855" with a 
	class of "single." The change caused is one that is synonymous and thus identified as
	a "sequence variant where there is no resulting change to the encoded amino acid." 
	If a selection of (ENST00000455775.7) had been made, this could also suffice as an 
	answer for (e).
